	description = <b>Program: Early Earth Observation Satellites<br><br><br>The satellite launched in the Early Satellites program returned valuable data about the space near Earth. Send a satellite to High Earth Orbit to detect cosmic rays so that we may better ascertain the shape and strength of the cosmic ray environment around Earth. Early scientific satellites also contained still-frame and video cameras to take photos of Earth from entirely new perspectives.&br;&br;<b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains a Cosmic Ray Science experiment.</color></b>&br;&br;Historical example: Explorer 7 (Juno II)

	synopsis = Launch a Scientific Satellite into an eccentric orbit of Earth with a Cosmic Ray Science experiment.

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The satellite you sent into orbit has returned extremely valuable data that has helped characterize the cosmic ray environment around Earth.
