	description = <b>Program: Early Earth Observation Satellites</b><br><br>It would be great for all humans if we could find a way to better predict the weather. One of the first steps in this is to understand the properties of the upper atmosphere. Launch a satellite with a Barometer on it to study the upper atmosphere. Transmit the science back to the KSC for analysis. This could be considered the first "Weather Satellite" and will open up new weather satellite opportunities. <b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains a barometer experiment.</color></b>

	synopsis = Launch a Satellite to study the upper atmosphere

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The information returned from the satellite has allowed our scientists to make some more accurate predictions of the weather. Our next step is to get a camera into orbit.
