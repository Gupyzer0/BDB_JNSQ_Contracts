	description = <b>Weather Satellites Program</b><br><br>The Atmospheric Analysis Satellite that we launched was a good first step to understanding how the upper atmosphere affects the weather. However, our meteorologists want to see images of the clouds to better assess the situation.&br;&br;Launch our first official weather satellite into orbit.
	synopsis = Launch the first weather satellite
	completedMessage = Success! The images provided from this satellite have proven that weather satellites can be extremely effective in helping meteorologists predict the weather.
