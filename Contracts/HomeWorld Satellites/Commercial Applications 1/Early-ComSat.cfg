Every major Telecom now wants their own satellite capabilities tailored to their specific needs. Launch new communications satellites with the required specifications into the specified orbits.<br><br><b><color=yellow>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color><br><br>The reward of this contract will slowly increase over time but will be reset to 0 after each completion.<br><b>Current reward is at @rewardFactorPercent % of its nominal value.
