	description = <b>Program: Crewed Orbit</b><br><br>Human beings are capable of conducting a unique class of science experiments, one robotic spacecraft simply can't match. We'd like you to fly orbital missions in order to learn about human beings in space, what they can do, and how they perceive things around them. All these experiments were conducted historically during the Mercury and Vostok programs. As part of this science campaign, we also need you to fly at least one flight that lasts a day or more in orbit. NOTE: You may have already collected some or all of this science. If you have, you won't need to collect it again, but you do need to fly at least one whole-day (or more) duration crewed flight.
	synopsis = Collect all basic crew science
	completedMessage = This is loads of data! Scientists are extremely happy with the results of your efforts.
