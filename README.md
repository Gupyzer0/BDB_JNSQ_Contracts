# Spacelines Progression
Sometimes I've thought of having some *blend* between Stock KSP and Realistic Progression 1 (RP1), but also having the BDB/JNSQ combo. 

On the other hand, my system can't handle Realism Overhaul (RO) well and the fact that I have to use the procedural tanks in RO instead of the BDB parts for most of the builds makes RO a bit cumbersome for me. so I decided to make the **Spacelines Progression**.

## What is the Spacelines Progression?
It's a combination of -sort of RP1- contracts modified to work with a non-modified Contract Configurator install using the JNSQ planet pack and BDB parts.
  
### Requirements
- JNSQ planet pack.
- Contract Configurator.
- Bluedog Design Bureau.
- Spacelines Kerbalism.

### Suggestions 
- Kerbal Construction Time - Now you need some time to make updates/ships!
- Engine Ignitor Re-ignited Release - Ah yes, the need for ullage, which is one of the best things in RO.

### This mod uses code/inspiration of these wonderful mods:
* RP-1 (Contracts).
* Bluedog Design Bureau (Contracts) / required parts for some contracts.
* History of Spaceflight contract pack (Gave me the idea).
