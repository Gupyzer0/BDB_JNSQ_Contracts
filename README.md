# Spacelines Progression
Sometimes I've thought of having some *blend* between Stock KSP and Realistic Progression 1 (RP1), but also having the BDB/JNSQ combo. 

On the other hand, my system can't handle Realism Overhaul (RO) well and the fact that I have to use the procedural tanks in RO instead of the BDB parts for most of the builds makes RO a bit cumbersome for me. so I decided to make the **Spacelines Progression**.

## What is the Spacelines Progression?
It's a combination of -sort of RP1- contracts modified to work with a non-modified Contract Configurator install using the JNSQ planet pack and BDB parts.
  
### Requirements
- JNSQ/KSRSS planet pack.
- Contract Configurator.
- Bluedog Design Bureau.
- Spacelines Kerbalism.

### Recommended Contract Packs to use with this pack
Made patches to make the Spacelines Progression to work with:
- [Constellations](https://github.com/IO5/KspConstellations): Used to make newer contracts for satellites, great after for getting some jobs after u finished the early commercial applications contracts. To those installing from GitHub, remember to rename the folder to "Constellations" and paste it inside the "ContractPacks" folder inside "GameData" otherwise the contract is unable to fetch the dummy vessel used to mark the position of the satellites in some of the contracts.

### Suggestions 
- Kerbal Construction Time - Now you need some time to make updates/ships!
- Engine Ignitor Re-ignited Release - Ah yes, the need for ullage, which is one of the best things in RO.

### This mod uses code/inspiration of these wonderful mods:
* RP-1 (Most of the contracts are adaptations of the RP-1 contracts).
* History of Spaceflight contract pack (Gave me the idea).
* K-Planes contract pack.
