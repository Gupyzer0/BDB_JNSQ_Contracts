# Spacelines Progression
Sometimes I've had the thought of having some *blend* between Stock KSP and Realisti Progression 1 (RP1), but also having the BDB/JNSQ combo. 

On the other hand my system can't handle Realism Overhaul (RO) well and also the fact that I have to be using the procedural tanks in RO instead of the BDB parts for most of the builds make RO a bit cumbersome for me. so I decided to make the **Spacelines Progression**.

## What is the Spacelines Progression?
It's a combination of RP1 contracts modified to work with a non-extended Contract Configurator install using the JNSQ planet pack and BDB parts but also using Custom barn Kit to add some new levels to unlock to the KSC Buildings.
  
### Requirements
- JNSQ planet pack.
- Contract Configurator.
- Bluedog Design Bureau.
- Custom Barn Kit.

### Suggestions 
- Kerbal Construction Time - Now you need some time for making updates!.
- OhScrap! - Adds random failures.
- ScrapYard  - Inventory of parts, dep of OhScrap!
- Engine Ignitor Re-ignited Release - Ah yes, the need for ullage, one of the best things in RO.

### This mod builds on top of other wonderful mods:
* RP-1 (Contracts).
* Bluedog Design Bureau (Contracts) / required parts for some contracts.
* History of Spaceflight contract pack (Gave me the idea).
* Komplexity (For it's custom barn kit configuration).
