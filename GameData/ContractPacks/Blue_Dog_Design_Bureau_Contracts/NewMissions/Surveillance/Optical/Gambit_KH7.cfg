	description = BYEMAN codenamed GAMBIT, the KH-7 (Air Force Program 206) is a reconnaissance satellite that, like the CORONA program satellites, acquires imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to Earth. The spacecraft is a 3-axis-stabilized satellite that separates from the Agena-D and contains the payload, camera system, and reentry vehicle (SRV). It's known as the OCV (Orbital Control Vehicle). The OCV body is a long cylinder, 1.52 meters in diameter and about 5.0 meters long, ending in a conical adapter connected to the SRV. The SRV is a 0.8 m long, 0.7 m diameter rounded cone with a mass of about 160 kg containing a Thiokol Star 12 retrorocket, with a mass of 33 kg full and 10 kg empty. The OCV was launched into a low-altitude sun-synchronous orbit on an Atlas Agena-D rocket.

	notes = The KH-7 was first successfully launched by a Atlas LV-3A Agena-D on July 12, 1963, from the Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex.
