LOFTI will attempt to determine whether very low frequency (VLF) energy could penetrate through the ionosphere and be received by submerged submarines. <br><br><b><color=yellow>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color>
