	description = <b>Program: Early Inner Planet Probes<br></b><br><br>Design and successfully launch an uncrewed probe to land on Ike, gather science, and bring something back to kerbin for study. This is a sample return missions so you cannot just transmit the data back, it needs to be physically returned.
	synopsis = Send an uncrewed craft to land on Ike and return the science to Earth.
	completedMessage = Congratulations! Our scientists can learn a lot more about the make-up of the planet by studying the physical samples that you have returned.
