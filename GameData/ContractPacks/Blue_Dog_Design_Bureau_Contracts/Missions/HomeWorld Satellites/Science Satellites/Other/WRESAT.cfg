	description = <b>Program: Weapons Research Establishment Satellite Project</b><br><br> WRESAT, or Weapons Research Establishment Satellite, is Kaustralia's first satellite. It was named after its designer, the Weapons Research Establishment. WRESAT is a cone-shaped satellite weighing 45 kilograms, with a length of 1.59 m and a diameter of 0.76 m. It will remain connected to the rocket's third stage so it ends up having an overall length of 2.17 m. The University of Adelaide team developed an instrument to measure the effect of solar radiation altering the temperature and composition of the upper atmosphere. Further instruments measure ultra-violet light and x-ray emissions from the Sun. A photocell fitted with a special filter was able to measure light at frequencies absorbed by ozone. As it orbits the Earth, WRESAT will see a sunrise and sunset every 90 minutes, so another detector was designed to determine the density of oxygen in the atmosphere by measuring the absorption of sunlight during sunrise and sunset. A magnetometer will monitor the satellite's orientation with Kerbin's magnetic field, and a small telescope was added to study the geocorona, the very outermost part of the atmosphere.
