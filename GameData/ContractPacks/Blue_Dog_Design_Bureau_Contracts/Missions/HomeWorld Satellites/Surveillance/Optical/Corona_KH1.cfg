	description = <b>Corona (Discoverer) Program</b><br><br>The Corona program started under the name "Discoverer" as part of the WS-117L satellite reconnaissance and protection program of the U.S. Air Force The primary goal of the program was to develop a film-return photographic satellite to replace the U-2 spyplane in surveilling the Sino-Soviet Bloc, determining the disposition and speed of production of Soviet missiles and long-range bombers assets. The Corona program was also used to produce maps and charts for the Department of Defense and other U.S. government mapping programs. Our first satellite is designated KH-1. KH stood for "Key Hole" with the name being an analogy to the act of spying into a person's room by peering through their door's keyhole. The KH-1 payload consists of the C (Corona) single panoramic camera and a single General Electric return vehicle (SRV, Satellite Return Vehicle). The satellite was based on the Agena-A upper stage, which provides attitude control in orbit. The film return capsule carries its own small solid-fuel retro motor to deorbit at the end of the mission with mid-air recovery of the returning capsule by a specially equipped aircraft.
