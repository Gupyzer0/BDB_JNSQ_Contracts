	description = Just putting an object in orbit is a stunt. Getting valuable scientific data from it is far more impressive.&br;&br;With the data returned from our sounding rockets, interesting radiation has been observed. We need you to send a scientific satellite into an eccentric orbit in order to study this data with more accuracy.Now we want to learn more about the effects of space (cosmic radiation, weightlessness, etc.) on biological matter.

	synopsis = Launch a Bio Satellite into orbit of Earth with a capsule capable of carrying biological experiments and recover it.

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The satellite you sent into orbit has returned extremely valuable data.
