	description = This is a repeat of Explorer 4 mission to get some extra data making detailed measurements of charged particles (protons and electrons) trapped in the terrestrial radiation belts.

	notes = Explorer 5 was a United States satellite and the fifth in the cylindrical series. It was the last of the original series of Explorers built, designed, and operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory I. The launch started out well, but failed when the rocket's first stage collided with its second stage after separation, causing the upper stage firing angle to be off. Explorer 5 had a mass of 17.24 kg. Explorer 5 was launched by a Juno I rocket on August 24, 1958 from Launch Complex 5 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
