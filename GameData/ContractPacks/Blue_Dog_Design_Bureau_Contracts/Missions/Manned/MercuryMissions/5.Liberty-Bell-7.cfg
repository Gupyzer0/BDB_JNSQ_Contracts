	description = Mercury-Redstone 4 (MR-4, also designated Liberty Bell 7) is the second flight of a crewed American rocket, and if everything goes right, the last Mercury program suborbital crewed flight before we roll out the Mercury-Atlas. The objectives of MR-4 are: familiarize man with a brief but complete space flight experience, including the lift-off, powered flight, weightless flight, re-entry, and landing phases of the flight; evaluate man's ability to perform as a functional unit during space flight by demonstrating manual control of spacecraft attitude before, during, and after retrofire and by use of voice communications during flight; study man's physiological reactions during space flight; and, qualify the explosively-actuated side egress hatch.	

	notes = Liberty Bell 7 was launched by a Redstone MRLV on July 21, 1961 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
