	description = Mercury-Atlas 8 (MA-8, also Sigma 7) is the third crewed orbital flight of the Mercury program. The objectives of MA-8 were to: evaluate the performance of the man-spacecraft system in a six-pass orbital mission; evaluate the effects of an extended orbital space flight on the astronaut and compare this analysis with those of previous missions and astronaut-simulator programs; obtain additional astronaut evaluation of the operational suitability of the spacecraft and support systems for crewed orbital flights; evaluate the performance of spacecraft systems replaced or modified as a result of previous three-pass orbital missions; and, evaluate the performance of and exercise further the Mercury Worldwide Network and mission support forces and establish their suitability for extended crewed flight. Two major modifications were made to the spacecraft to eliminate difficulties encountered during the previous two flights. The first was an alteration of the reaction control system to disarm the high-thrust jets and to permit the use of the low-thrust jets only in manual operation (to conserve fuel). The second was the addition of two high-frequency antennas (mounted on the retro package) to assist and maintain spacecraft and ground communications throughout the flight.

	notes = Sigma-7 was launched by an Atlas LV-3B on October 3, 1962 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
