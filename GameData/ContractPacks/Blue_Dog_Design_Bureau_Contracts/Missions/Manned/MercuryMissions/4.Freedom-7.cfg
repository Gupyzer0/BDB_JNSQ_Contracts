	description = Mercury-Redstone 3 (MR-3, also designated Freedom 7) is the first crewed flight of an American rocket. The objectives of MR-3 are: familiarize man with a brief but complete space flight experience, including the lift-off, powered flight, weightless flight (approximately 5 minutes), re-entry, and landing phases of the flight; evaluate man's ability to perform as a functional unit during space flight by demonstrating manual control of spacecraft attitude before, during, and after retrofire and by use of voice communications during flight; study man's physiological reactions during space flight; and, recover the astronaut and spacecraft. 

	notes = Freedom 7 was launched by a Redstone MRLV on May 5, 1961 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
