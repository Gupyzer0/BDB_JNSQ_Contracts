	description = <b>Program: Advanced Crewed Orbit</b><br><br>The first successful rendezvous between two spacecraft was when Gemini 6 and 7 met in 1965. Wally Schirra maneuvered Gemini 6 to within 30 cm of Gemini 7, close enough and precise enough to prove that docking two craft together in space was possible. Using your own knowledge of orbital mechanics, bring two craft to within 100 meters of each other while in orbit around Earth. At least one of the spacecraft must be a new launch.

	synopsis = Perform the First Rendezvous of two craft in space
	completedMessage = Congratulations! By accomplishing the first rendezvous, it opens up the possibilities of what we can do while in orbit.
