	description = The OSCAR (Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio) is an amateur radio satellite. The satellite has a battery-powered 140 MW transmitter operating in the 2-meter band (144.983 MHz), a monopole transmitting antenna 60 cm long extended from the center of the convex surface, but has no attitude control system. Like Sputnik 1, Oscar 1 carries only a simple beacon for transmitting its Morse Code message "HI"which also indicates laughter in amateur telegraphy.

	notes = OSCAR-1 was launched by a Thor-DM21 Agena B launcher on December 12, 1961 as a piggy back payload on a Corona program launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base.
