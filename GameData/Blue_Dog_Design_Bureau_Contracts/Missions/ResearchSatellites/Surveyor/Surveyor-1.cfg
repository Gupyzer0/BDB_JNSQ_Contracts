	description = Surveyor 1 is the first spacecraft of the Surveyor program and the first try for a soft landing on the @targetBody. The primary objectives of the Surveyor program, a series of seven robotic lunar soft-landing flights, is to support the coming crewed Apollo landings by: developing and validating the technology for landing softly on the Moon; providing data on the compatibility of the Apollo design with conditions encountered on the lunar surface; and adding to the scientific knowledge of the Moon.

	notes = Surveyor 1 was launched by an Atlas LV-3C - Centaur D on May 30, 1966 from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
