    description = Ranger 1 is a prototype spacecraft launched as part of the Ranger program of uncrewed space missions. Its primary mission was is testing the performance of those functions and parts necessary for carrying out subsequent lunar and planetary missions. A secondary objective is to study the nature of particles and fields in the space environment.
