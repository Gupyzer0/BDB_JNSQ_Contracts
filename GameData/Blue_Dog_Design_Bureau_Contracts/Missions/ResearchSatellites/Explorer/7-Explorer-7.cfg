	description = Explorer 7 is a 41.5 kg satellite designed to measure solar X-ray and Lyman-alpha flux, trapped energetic particles, and heavy primary cosmic rays (Z>5). Secondary objectives included collecting data on micrometeoroid penetration and molecular sputtering and studying the earth-atmosphere heat balance. It was the last of the seven satellites that the United States orbited for the International Geophysical Year (IGY). The spin-stabilized satellite's external structure consisted of two truncated conical fiberglass shells, 75 cm tall by 75 cm wide, joined by a cylindrical aluminum center section. Powered by approximately 3,000 solar cells, it also carried 15 nickel-cadmium batteries around its equator.
   
	notes = Explorer 7 was launched on a Juno-II rocket on October 13, 1959 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
