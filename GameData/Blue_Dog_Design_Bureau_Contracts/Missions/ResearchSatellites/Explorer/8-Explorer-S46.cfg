	description = Explorer S-46 is an American earth magnetosphere satellite. Its mission is to analyze electron and proton radiation energies in a highly elliptical orbit.         

	notes = If it had reached orbit, it would have received an Explorer designation. It carried the following experiments: a CDS Proton Detector, an Electron Spectrometer, a High Energy GM Tube and a Medium Energy GM Tube. Explorer S-46 was launched by a Juno-II on March 23, 1960 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex. Launch vehicle telemetry was lost shortly after the first stage burnout and one of the upper stages failed to fire. The spacecraft did not achieve orbit. S-46 had a mass of 15.7 kg
