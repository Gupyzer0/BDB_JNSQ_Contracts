	description = Explorer 30 (NRL SOLRAD 8) was one of the SOLRAD series that began in 1960 to provide continuous coverage of solar radiation with a set of standard photometers. SOLRAD 8 is a 56.7 kg spin-stabilized satellite oriented with its spin axis perpendicular to the sun-satellite line so that the 14 solar X-ray and ultraviolet photometers pointing radially outward from its equatorial belt viewed the sun with each revolution. Data is transmitted in real time by means of an FM/AM telemetry system and were recorded by the stations on the STADAN tracking network.

	notes = Explorer 30 was launched by a Scout X-4 on November 19, 1965 from the Wallops Island Launch Complex.
