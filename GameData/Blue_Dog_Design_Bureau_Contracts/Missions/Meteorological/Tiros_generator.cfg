	description = The TIROS Program (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) is NASA's first experimental step to determine if satellites could be useful in the study of the Earth. At that time, the effectiveness of satellite observations are still unproven. Since satellites are a new technology, the TIROS Program was made to test various design issues for spacecraft: instruments data, and operational parameters. The goal is to improve satellite applications for Earth-bound decisions, such as "Should we evacuate the coast because of the hurricane?".

	notes = TIROS 1 was launched by a Thor-Able on April 1, 1960 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex. Other launch systems include: Tiros 2 to 6 by a Delta, Tiros 7 by a Delta-B and Tiros 10 by a Delta-C.
