	description = The Gemini has proved itself to be a capable spacecraft and now McDonnell submitted a report titled "Gemini - Large Earth Orbit" on June 19th 1965. In the report they suggest that with 'modest revisions' they feel the Gemini vehicle would be capable of undertaking flights to far greater altitudes via rendezvous with additional propulsion stages. Unsurprisingly one of the very large orbit missions they feel could be undertaken is a circumlunar flight. Rather than use NASA's Saturn 1B, the report proposes two configurations using Titan launch vehicles. The first is for a two-launch mission with the Gemini launching on the standard Titan II before rendezvousing with a modified Titan IIIC transtage launched separately on a Titan IIIC (then in development for the Air Force). The transtage would be fitted with the McDonnell built Target Docking Adapter (TDA) as used in the core Gemini programme. The transtage would then boost the combined vehicle onto a free-return trajectory with the astronauts again facing away from the direction of travel. The second configuration proposed a single launch direct version of the mission with a Titan IIIC launching both the Gemini vehicle and the transtage. In this second configuration, the transtage would be behind the Gemini, so the astronauts would be facing in the direction of travel during the transtage burn. Martin Marietta followed this with their own study Rendezvous Concept for Circumlunar Flyby in 1967 in July 1965 covering broadly the same ground. Also Jim Chamberlin's team, (architect of the Mark II/Gemini) and the McDonnell engineers feel that by substituting the more powerful high-energy Centaur stage for the Agena, the combined vehicle could boost away from Earth orbit and travel on a free return trajectory to the moon.

	notes = You might use a Saturn IB/Titan III for a Direct ascent mission or perhaps dock in orbit of Kerbin with a booster (Transtage / Centaur) and reach the Mun.
