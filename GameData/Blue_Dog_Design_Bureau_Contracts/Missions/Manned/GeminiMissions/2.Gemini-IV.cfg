	description = Gemini IV was the second crewed mission of the Gemini series. The mission included the first American spacewalk. The objective of the mission was to test the performance of the astronauts and capsule and to evaluate work procedures, schedules, and flight planning for an extended length of time in space. Secondary objectives included the demonstration of extravehicular activity in space, conduct station keeping and rendezvous maneuvers, evaluate spacecraft systems, demonstrate the capability to make significant in-plane and out-of-plane maneuvers, and use of the maneuvering system as a backup reentry system and conduct 11 experiments.

	notes = Gemini IV was launched by a Titan II GLV on June 3, 1965 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
