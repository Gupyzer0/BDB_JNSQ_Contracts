	description = Gemini VI-A is the fifth crewed Earth-orbiting spacecraft of the Gemini series. After that failed launch of their assigned Agena Docking Target, the mission got scrubbed and is now set to launch after Gemini VII, with the intent of making rendezvous with Gemini VII in Earth orbit. The mission priorities are to demonstrate on-time launch procedures, closed-loop rendezvous capabilities, and stationkeeping techniques with Gemini VII. Other objectives are to evaluate the spacecraft reentry guidance capabilities and conduct spacecraft systems tests and four experiments.

	notes = Gemini VI-A was launched by a Titan II GLV on December 25, 1965 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
