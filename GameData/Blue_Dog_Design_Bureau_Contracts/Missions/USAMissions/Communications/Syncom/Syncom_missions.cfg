	description = Syncom (for "synchronous communication satellite") is a NASA program for active geosynchronous communication satellites. The satellites are experimental spacecraft built by Hughes Aircraft Company. All three satellites are cylindrical in shape, with a diameter of about 71 centimeters and a height of about 39 centimeters. Pre-launch wet masses are 68 kilograms, and orbital masses are 39 kilograms with a 25-kilogram payload. They are capable of emitting signals on two transponders at just 2 W. Thus, Syncom satellites are only capable of carrying a single two-way telephone conversation, or 16 Teletype connections.

	notes = The first successful Syncom launch was Syncom 2 on July 26, 1963 by a Delta-B rocket from Cape Cannaveral Launch Complex.
