	description = Developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories for AT&T, Telstar is to be the world's first active communications satellite and the world's first commercial payload in space. It's mission is to demonstrate feasibility of transmitting information via satellite, gain experience in satellite tracking and study the effect of Van Allen radiation belts on future satellite design. The satellite is spin-stabilized to maintain its desired orientation in space. Power to its onboard equipment is provided by a solar array, in conjunction with a battery back-up system.

	notes = Telstar 1 was launched by a Thor-Delta on July 10, 1962 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
