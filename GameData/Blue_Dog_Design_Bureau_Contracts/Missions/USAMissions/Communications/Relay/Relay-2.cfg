	description = Relay 2, physically similar to Relay 1, has two transmitters, one of which was used for PCM telemetry (the sequence requiring about 1 s). Design changes in this satellite improved its performance to the point where the response to spurious commands was essentially eliminated. 

	notes = Relay 2 was launched by a Delta-B on January 21, 1964 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
