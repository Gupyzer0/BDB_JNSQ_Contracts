	description = POPPY is the code name given to a series of U.S. intelligence satellites operated by the National Reconnaissance Office. The POPPY satellites are designed to record electronic signals intelligence (ELINT) data, targeting radar installations in the Soviet Union and Soviet naval ships at sea. Block I POPPY satellites have a diameter of 20 inches (51 cm), identical to the diameter of the GRAB satellites. Block II POPPY satellites have a diameter of 24 inches (61 cm) and an increased weight compared to the Block I satellites. The POPPY satellites are intended to find “new and unusual” emitters, equipped with electronics that could scan widely like a pair of binoculars searching the electromagnetic horizon.

	notes = A pair of Poppy Block I satellties were first launched by a Thor-Agena-D on December 13, 1962 and the first time both Poppy Block I and Block II were launched together by a Thor-SLV2A Agena-D on January 11, 1964.
