	description = Courier 1A is an experimental military communications satellite. Courier was a successor to the SCORE program. The objective of the mission is to put the satellite into Earth orbit and test the feasibility of a global military communications network using "delayed repeater" satellites, which receive and store information until commanded to transmit. Courier 1A is covered with 19,200 solar cells, charging nickel-cadmium batteries, providing 60 W power, and a mass of 225 kg. The satellite has the capability to simultaneously transmit, receive, and store approximately 68,000 coded words per minute.

	notes = Courier 1A was launched by a Thor-Ablestar on August 18, 1960 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
