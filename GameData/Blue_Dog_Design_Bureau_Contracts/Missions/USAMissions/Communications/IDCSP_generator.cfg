	description = The Initial Defense Communications Satellite Program is designed to provide the Pentagon with its first geosynchronous communications system. IDCSP satellites are spin-stabilized 26-sided polygons, 86 cm in diameter, covered with solar panels, and had a mass of 45 kg. Eight are dispersed on a single Titan 3C rocket into a slightly sub-synchronous orbit where they would drift about thirty degrees per day. The idea is that a backup was always visible to the Earth station if one failed.
	
	notes = The first IDCSP satellite constellation was first launched by a Titan IIIC on June 16, 1966 from the Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex.
