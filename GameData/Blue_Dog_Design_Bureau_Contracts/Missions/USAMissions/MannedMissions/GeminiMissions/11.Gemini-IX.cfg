	description = Gemini 9A is the seventh crewed Earth-orbiting spacecraft of the Gemini series. Its primary mission objectives are to demonstrate rendezvous techniques and docking with a target vehicle to simulate maneuvers to be carried out on future Apollo missions, an ExtraVehicular Activity (EVA) spacewalk to test the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), and precision landing capability. Scientific objectives included obtaining zodiacal light and airglow horizon photographs.

	notes = Gemini IX was launched by a Titan II GLV on June 3, 1965 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
