	description = Gemini III is the first crewed Earth-orbiting spacecraft of the Gemini series. The primary objective is to demonstrate the crewed qualifications of the Gemini spacecraft including evaluation of the two-man Gemini design, the worldwide tracking network, the orbit attitude and maneuver system (OAMS), the control of reentry flight path and landing point, spacecraft systems, and spacecraft recovery. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of flight crew equipment and the effects of low-level launch vehicle oscillations (POGO) on the crew, the performance of three experiments, and obtaining photographic coverage from orbit.

	notes = Gemini III was launched by a Titan II GLV on March 23, 1965 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
