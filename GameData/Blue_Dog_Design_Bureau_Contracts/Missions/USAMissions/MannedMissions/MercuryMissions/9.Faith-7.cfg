	description = Mercury-Atlas 9 (MA-9, designated also Faith 7) is the fourth and final manned orbital flight of the Mercury program. The objectives of MA-9 were to: evaluate the effects on the astronaut of approximately one day in orbital flight; verify that man can function for an extended period in space as a primary operating system of the spacecraft; and, evaluate in a manned one-day mission the combined performance of the astronaut and a Mercury spacecraft specifically modified for the mission. A number of alterations were made to the MA-9 spacecraft, most of them due to the extended duration of the flight. Among these were the increased capacity of several life support system components (additional oxygen and water, increased urine and condensate capacity, etc.), a larger capacity fuel tank, and larger capacity batteries (two 3,000 W-hour vs. two 1,500 W-hour). Deleted from the flight, due to weight considerations, were several backup or other components deemed unnecessary. These included the periscope, the backup UHF voice transmitter, the rate control system, and the backup telemetry transmitter. Also installed was a slow-scan television unit for in-flight evaluation in monitoring the astronaut and instruments.
