    description = The Convair SM-65D Atlas, or Atlas D, was the first operational version of the U.S. Atlas missile. Atlas D was first used as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to deliver a nuclear weapon payload on a suborbital trajectory. It was later developed as a launch vehicle to carry a payload to low Earth orbit on its own, and later to geosynchronous orbit, to the Moon, Venus, or Mars with the Agena or Centaur upper stage.
	
	notes = Launch the SM-65D-Atlas full scale prototype on a sub-orbital trajectory, reach 200 km downrange and impact the surface.	
    synopsis = <color=yellow>The SM-65A Atlas was first launched on June 11, 1957 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.</color>
