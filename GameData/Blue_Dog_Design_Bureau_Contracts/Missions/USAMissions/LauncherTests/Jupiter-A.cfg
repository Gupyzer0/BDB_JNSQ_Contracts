	description = The Redstone was the first large liquid rocket developed in the US using German V-2 technology. The Jupiter A was the first adaptation of the Redstone MRBM used for testing certain components which would be incorporated into the Jupiter IRBM. Although it could correctly be classified as a Redstone, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) named the vehicle Jupiter A to more closely associate it with its Jupiter missile development program. This was primarily due to increasing competition for launch dates at Cape Canaveral. Out of necessity, certain programs were given priority over others when launch dates were selected. For a time, nearly the highest priority was given to Jupiter-related test flights. For this reason, the name Jupiter A more precisely identified the purpose of the vehicle, and guaranteed a much higher scheduling priority than an ordinary Redstone might have received.
