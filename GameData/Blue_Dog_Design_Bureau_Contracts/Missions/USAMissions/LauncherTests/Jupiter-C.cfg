    description = Because of the severe dynamic stresses and intense heat encountered by an object reentering the earth's atmosphere, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency early recognized the necessity of developing nose cone construction methods and materials to protect the payload during reentry. For these tests, the Agency used the composite rocket, first proposed for use in Project Orbiter. Despite the fact 2 that the vehicle was a modified Redstone, the Agency designated it Jupiter-C because of its use in the Jupiter development program. //John W. Bullard - History of the redstone missile system

	notes = The Jupiter-C was an American three stage research and development vehicle developed from the Jupiter-A. Jupiter-C was used for three sub-orbital spaceflights in 1956 and 1957 to test re-entry nosecones that were later to be deployed on the more advanced PGM-19 Jupiter mobile missile. A member of the Redstone rocket family, Jupiter-C was designed by the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), under the direction of Wernher von Braun. There were three Jupiter-C flights before it was modified with the addition of the fourth stage, which consisted of a single sergeant rocket. This modified Jupiter-C, with the added fourth stage, became known as Juno-I and was used to orbit the first U.S satellite. The Jupiter-C was first successfully launched on August 8, 1957 from the Cape Canaveral launch site.
