	description = The Nimbus satellites are second-generation U.S. robotic spacecraft used for meteorological research and development. The spacecraft is designed to serve as stabilized, Earth-oriented platforms for the testing of advanced systems to sense and collect atmospheric science data. The solar paddles and the control system housing are connected to the sensory ring by a truss structure, giving the satellite the appearance of an ocean buoy. Nimbus 1 is nearly 3.7 m tall, 1.5 m in diameter at the base, and about 3 m across with solar paddles extended. The sensory ring, which formed the satellite base, houses the electronics equipment and battery modules. The lower surface of the torus-shaped sensory ring provided mounting space for sensors and telemetry antennas. An H-frame structure mounted within the center of the torus provides support for the larger experiments and tape recorders. Mounted on the control system housing, which is located on top of the spacecraft, were sun sensors, horizon scanners, gas nozzles for attitude control, and a command antenna. The use of a stabilization and control system allows the spacecraft's orientation to be controlled to within plus or minus 1 deg for all three axes (pitch, roll, and yaw).
	
    notes = Nimbus-1 was launched by a Thor Agena-B on August 28, 1964 from Vandenberg Air Force Base.
