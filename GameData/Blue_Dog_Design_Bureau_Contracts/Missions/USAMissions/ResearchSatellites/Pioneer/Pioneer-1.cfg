	description = Pioneer 1, the second and most successful of three project Able space probes and the first spacecraft launched by the newly formed NASA, was intended to study the ionizing radiation, cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and micrometeorites in the vicinity of the Earth and in lunar orbit. Due to a launch vehicle malfunction, the spacecraft attained only a ballistic trajectory and never reached the Moon. It did return data on the near-Earth space environment. Pioneer 1 had a mass of 34.2 kg.
	
	notes = Launch Pioneer-1 on a ballistic trajectory towards the Mun. Orbit the Mun if you're able to do so.
