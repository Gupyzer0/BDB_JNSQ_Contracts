	description = Pioneer P-3 is intended to be a lunar orbiter probe. The objectives are to place a highly instrumented probe in lunar orbit, to investigate the environment between the Earth and Moon, and to develop technology for controlling and maneuvering spacecraft from Earth. It is equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, and study radiation, magnetic fields, and low frequency electromagnetic waves in space.

	notes = Pioneer P-3 was launched by an Atlas Able on November 26, 1959 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex and failed to reach the moon due to engine cut-off.
