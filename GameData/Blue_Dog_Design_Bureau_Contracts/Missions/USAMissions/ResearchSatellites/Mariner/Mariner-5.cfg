	description = Mariner 5 is a refurbished backup spacecraft for the Mariner 4 Duna mission converted to flyby Eve mission as Mariner 4 was a success. Mariner 5 carries a complement of experiments to probe Eve's atmosphere with radio waves, scan its brightness in ultraviolet light, and sample the solar particles and magnetic field fluctuations above the planet. Mariner 5 omits several experiments from Mariner 4, including the TV camera, the ionization chamber/geiger counter, the cosmic ray detector, and the cosmic dust detector. It retains the helium-vector magnetometer, solar plasma probe, and trapped radiation detector from Mariner 4. Unlike Mariner 4, Mariner 5 needs to face away from the Sun to keep its high-gain antenna pointed at Earth because of its trajectory. As a result, the solar panels were reversed to be aft facing so they could remain pointed at the Sun. Additionally, since its mission to Eve will brought it in closer proximity to the Sun, fewer solar cells were needed to achieve the necessary power generation, and as a result the solar panels are reduced in size to save mass as well as to make room for two 50 MHz dual-frequency receiver (DFR) antennas that were mounted on the frame of two of the solar panels. Since the aft side of the spacecraft faced the Sun, the solar plasma probe was relocated to the aft-facing side of Mariner 5.
	notes = Mariner 5 was launched by an Atlas Agena D on June 14, 1967 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
