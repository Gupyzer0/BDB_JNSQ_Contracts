	title = Mariner 9

	description = The Mariner @targetBody 71 mission consists of two spacecraft on complementary missions, but due to the failure of Mariner 8 to launch properly, only one spacecraft is available. Mariner 9 combines mission objectives of both Mariner 8 (mapping 70 % of the Martian surface) and Mariner 9 (a study of temporal changes in the Martian atmosphere and on the Martian surface). For the survey portion of the mission, the planetary surface is to be mapped with the same resolution as planned for the original mission, although the resolution of pictures of the polar regions will be decreased due to the increased slant range.

	notes = Mariner 9 was launched by an Atlas-SLV3C Centaur-D on May 30, 1971 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
