	title = Orbital Solar Observatory

	description = The objectives of the OSO satellite series were to perform solar physics experiments above the atmosphere during a complete solar cycle and to map the celestial sphere for direction and intensity of UV light, X-rays, and gamma radiation. The OSO 1 was the first satellite to have pointed instruments and onboard tape recorders for data storage. The OSO 1 platform consisted of a sail section, which pointed two experiments continuously toward the sun, supplying power to the experiments from the solar batteries and rechargeable chemical batteries; and a wheel section, which spun about an axis perpendicular to the pointing direction of the sail and carried seven experiments.&br;&br;The spacecraft performed normally until the second onboard tape recorder failed May 15, 1962. The spacecraft provided real-time data until May 1964, when the power cells failed. It had a mass of 207.7 kg.

	notes = OSO 1 was launched by a Delta-C on March 7, 1962 from the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex.
