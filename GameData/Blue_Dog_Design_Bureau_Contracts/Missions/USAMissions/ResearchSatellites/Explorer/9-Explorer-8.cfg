    description = Explorer 8 is a mercury-battery-powered, earth-orbiting satellite designed to obtain measurements of the electron density, the electron temperature, the ion concentration, the ion mass, the micrometeorite distribution, and the micrometeorite mass in the ionosphere at altitudes between 400 and 1600 km. It was intended to study the temporal and spatial distribution of these properties and their variation from full sunlit conditions to full shadow, or nighttime, conditions. To avoid the possibility of effects on the experiments by asymmetrical charging on solar cell surfaces, solar cells were not used. Experiment instrumentation included an RF impedance probe, an ion current monitor, a retarding potential probe, a two-element and a three-element electron temperature probe, an electron current monitor, a photomultiplier-type and a microphone-type micrometeorite detector, an electric field meter, a solar horizon sensor, and thermistor temperature probes.
