	description = <b>Explorers Program</b><br><br>Explorer SE-A is one of the SOLRAD series made to provide continuous coverage of solar radiation with a set of standard photometers. Explorer SE-A is a 56.7 kg spin-stabilized satellite oriented with its spin axis perpendicular to the sun-satellite line so that the 14 solar X-ray and ultraviolet photometers pointing radially outward from its equatorial belt viewed the sun with each revolution. Data is transmitted in real time by means of an FM/AM telemetry system and were recorded by the stations on the STADAN tracking network.
	synopsis = Launch the Explorer SE-A satellite into a circular orbit.
